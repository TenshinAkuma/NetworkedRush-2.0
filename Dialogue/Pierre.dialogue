		Ms. Pierre: Ah, {{player_name}}!  Thank you for coming so quickly. Sandy and I have been trying to figure out the best way to connect our computers.
		Ms. Pierre: We want to share all our amazing recipe ideas digitally, but technology isn't exactly my forte.
		Ms. Pierre: Yeah, every time we try to transfer files with a flash drive, it takes forever!  There's gotta be a better way, right?
		{{player_name}}: Absolutely!  Considering your budget, a ring network could be a good temporary solution.
		do show_topology_hint("ring", true)
		{{player_name}}: A ring topology allows all your devices to connect in a loop and share information.
		Ms. Pierre:  A loop, huh? Sounds a littleâ€¦ twisty.
		{{player_name}}: It's more like a circle, really.  Think of it like holding hands in a ring game. Data gets passed from one device to the next until it reaches its destination.
		{{player_name}}:  A ring network does have a downside. If one device malfunctions, the entire network goes down.
		do show_topology_hint("ring", false)
		Ms. Pierre: Oh dear, that's not ideal.
		{{player_name}}: Don't worry,  we can configure things to minimize the risk.
		{{player_name}}: Let's get these network cards installed and set up a data flow sequence. Think of it like taking turns sharing stories in a circle.

		Ms. Pierre: Wow, that was fun!  And it actually works!
		Ms. Pierre: Thank you so much, [Player Name]!  This is a lifesaver!!!.
		MMs. Pierre: Here's a gift of thanks for your effort.
		do update_objective(current_task_id)
		{{player_name}}: Happy to help!  Just remember, this ring network is a good starting point,
		{{player_name}}: but for long-term scalability, a star topology with a switch might be better.

		Ms. Pierre: Hellooo neighbor, how are you today?
		Ms. Pierre: I hope you're fine, unlike me, I have a problem.

	Ms. Pierre: Hello neighbor from upstaires. I heard you're good at networks.
	{{player_name}}: Just a regular guy with regular skills -_<
