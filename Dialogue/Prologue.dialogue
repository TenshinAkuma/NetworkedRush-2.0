		Developer:  Used to be quite the city slicker yourself, weren't you? Burned out on the corporate grind, they say. Craved a change of pace.
		Developer: Fresh air, friendly neighbors... and apparently, a whole lot less bandwidth.
		{{player_name}}: Yeah, the city wasn't cutting it anymore
		{{player_name}}: Needed a slower pace. Maybe some time to think.
		Developer: Well, Netville might not have the blazing-fast internet speeds you're used to, but that's where you come in, {{player_name}}.
		Developer: Your expertise in network engineering is the talk of the town. Seems everyone here needs a helping hand getting connected
		Developer: Netville might be a small town, but its digital needs are growing!
		Developer: Are you ready to put your skills to the test and become Netville's very own Network Hero?
		- Yes, abosolutely!
			Developer: Excellent! Then let's get started. Your first client awaits!
		- *Non-chalantly.... yeah =|
			Developer: okay........?
			Developer: Anyway,let's get going.
			Developer: Check your computer too see available tasks.
